A simple Flutter app. Connect a MIDI device i.e. digital piano and try yourself out.

You can build on top of this. If you're planning a release an app with this base, then include me as a co-author or contributor. 

Caveat: This is a minimal set up with no abstractions etc., yet proper-ish architecture. Using Riverpod for DI and StateNotifier for state management.
