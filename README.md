# Piano test

Note: work in progress

A simple Flutter app. Connect a MIDI device i.e. digital piano and try yourself out.

This is a side project of my. Feel free to do whatever with it, just link to the original. 

Caveat: This is a minimal set up with no abstractions etc., yet proper architecture. Using Riverpod for DI and StateNotifier for state management.
